#### Assignment: Working with Arrays

**Objective:**
The goal of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with arrays in C, including how to declare, initialize, and iterate through them. You will also practice performing basic operations on array elements.

**Tasks:**

1. **Declare and Initialize an Array:**

   - Declare an array of integers named `scores` with a size of 10.
   - Initialize the array with the values: 95, 86, 78, 64, 89, 99, 73, 55, 92, 81.

1. **Print the Array Elements:**

   - Write a `for` loop to iterate through the array and print each element.

1. **Calculate the Sum and Average:**

   - Write a `for` loop to calculate the sum of the elements in the array.
   - Calculate the average of the elements and print it.

1. **Find the Maximum and Minimum Values:**

   - Write a `for` loop to find and print the maximum value in the array.
   - Write a `for` loop to find and print the minimum value in the array.

**Submission:**

- Submit your code file named `array_assignment.c`.
- Ensure your code is properly commented and formatted.
